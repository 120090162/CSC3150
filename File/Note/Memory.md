# Memory



##  Background

Program must be brought from disk and placed within a process to run it

CPU can only access the main memory and registers directly, and Cache is between them

Hence, memory need to be protected, how to protect?

**use base and limit register** to check the range



* Address binding 

Programs on disk, ready to be brought into memory to execute form an input queue.  (Three type)
Then we need a mechanism for computer to access and map the memory

-- Then we have the logic and Physical memory
